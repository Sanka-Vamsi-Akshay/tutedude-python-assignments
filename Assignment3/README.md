# Assignment 3: Functions & Modules in Python


## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
- **File:** `task1.py`
- **Description:**  
  This program defines a function named `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a given number using either a loop or recursion.  
  The function is called with a sample number, and the resulting factorial is printed to the console.

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
- **File:** `task2.py`
- **Description:**  
  This program prompts the user to input a number and uses Pythonâ€™s built-in `math` module to compute:
  - The square root of the number
  - The natural logarithm (log base *e*) of the number
  - The sine of the number (interpreted as radians)  
  The results of each calculation are displayed on the screen.
