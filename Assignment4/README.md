# Assignment 4: Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python


## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
- **File:** `task1.py`
- **Description:**  
  This program attempts to open and read the contents of a file named `sample.txt`.  
  It prints the file content line by line.  
  If the file does not exist, it handles the error gracefully and displays an appropriate message.

## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
- **File:** `task2.py`
- **Description:**  
  This program:
  1. Takes input from the user and writes it to a file named `output.txt`
  2. Appends more data to the same file
  3. Finally reads and displays the full content of `output.txt`  
  It demonstrates file writing, appending, and reading operations in Python.
